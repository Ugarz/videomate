# Videomate [WIP]

A simple project to fasten my video editing process.

Allow me to practice Python and to do a cool project helping me to produce videos.

# Structure

- `assets` is for all external assets to play with (images, sounds, etc).
- `input` is for all the videos to be processed.
- `output` is for the final video after the process.

# Objectives
- [ ] Can concatenate multiple videos
- [ ] Can add Intro and Outro
- [ ] Can edit in several formats to share on medias
